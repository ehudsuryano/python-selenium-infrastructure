# Python Selenium Infrastructure

## Overview

Welcome to the **Python Selenium Infrastructure** repository!  
This project is a robust, scalable, and PEP 8-compliant testing framework designed for efficient and comprehensive web testing. It leverages **Selenium WebDriver**, the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, and a layered architecture to provide a reliable and maintainable infrastructure for automated testing.

## Features

- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports multiple browser drivers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run tests concurrently for faster results.  
- **HTML Reporting:** Generates detailed test reports using Extent Reports or compatible libraries.  
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Simplifies test maintenance by separating test logic from UI elements.  
- **Scalable Design:** Easily extend the framework for future testing needs.  
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Clean, readable, and Pythonic code.

## Requirements

To use this framework, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Selenium WebDriver
- Browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)
- [Install other dependencies as needed, e.g., pytest, pytest-xdist, etc.]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
